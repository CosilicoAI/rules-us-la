            <p>The authority of the standing committees of the Senate to meet in the interim
between sessions upon approval of a majority of the members thereof shall be contingent
upon compliance with the provisions herein set forth and approval of the President.  Upon

hearings, either as a Senate committee or as a joint committee, the chairman of the
committee or any member thereof shall submit to the President, in writing, the
recommendation and request of the committee for such interim meetings. The written
recommendation and request shall set forth the scope of the study proposed to be made by
the committee, the number of meetings anticipated, and the estimated cost.  The President
shall determine if funds for such meetings are available.  If funds are available, the
standing committee, with approval of the President, may proceed with the meetings. If a
question is raised as to the subject matter jurisdiction of the committee proposing to make
the study, the jurisdictional question shall be resolved by the President in accordance with
the provisions of Rule 13.4.</p>
