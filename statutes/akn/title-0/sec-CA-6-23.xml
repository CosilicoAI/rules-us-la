Louisiana shall in each fiscal year set aside for the payment of the principal
and interest of all bonds issued under the authority of this Section, which may
then be outstanding, the aggregate amount of the principal and interest due
thereon in such fiscal year and the amount contracted to be set aside in said
fiscal year in sinking funds or reserve funds for the payment of the principal
of such bonds dues in subsequent fiscal years.  Said bonds shall mature at such

and other motor fuels and the additional tax thereon of one cent (1¢) per gallon
now levied under authority of Article VI, Section 22, of the Constitution, shall

If science or invention should reduce the use and consumption of
gasoline, benzine, naphtha or other motor fuels to such an extent that the tax

Legislature shall have the authority to levy a tax upon any commodity,
substance, appliance or paraphernalia, or to impose a license upon the right to
sell or make use of such commodity, substance, appliance or paraphernalia,
which may be sold or used to generate or supply motor fuel or other power for
transportation; to levy such tax or license, or both, or such other taxes as may
be necessary to pay said bonds and the interest thereon, and this authority shall
in no wise affect the tax levied under the authority of the Constitution and
statutes of the State upon gasoline, benzine, naphtha or other motor fuel as
defined by law, or be subject to any limitation imposed by the Constitution.
In like manner, the one cent (1¢) gasoline tax levied under Article
