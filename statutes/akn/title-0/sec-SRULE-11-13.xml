EXPLANATION OF TABLE
&quot;Yes&quot; shows that the rule heading the column in which it stands applies to the
motion opposite to which it is placed.  &quot;No&quot; shows that the rule does not apply.  A figure
shows that the rule only partially applies -- the figure referring to the note showing the
limitation.  Take, for example, &quot;Lay on the Table.&quot;  The table shows that it is undebatable,
does not open main question, cannot be amended, an affirmative vote as shown by note
No. 8 cannot be reconsidered, requires a majority vote, and is not in order when another
has the floor.
NOTES TO TABLE RELATING TO MOTIONS
1. Since motions are never amended in the Senate, this heading is somewhat
misleading. What is meant is that the motion can be altered in some respect by a
substitute motion -- for example, the motion to lay on the table cannot be altered by a
substitute motion, but the motion to fix the time and day to which to adjourn can be
altered by a substitute motion to name another day and/or time.
2. Vote required:  M -- Majority of those present and voting; ME -- Majority of
those elected.
3. An appeal is undebatable only when relating</p>

            <content>
              <p>when made
while the previous question is pending.  When debatable, only two speeches from each
member are allowed.
4. The vote on a motion to appeal may be reconsidered, but when the subject
matter upon which the appeal was taken has been disposed of, and it is impossible for the
Senate to reverse its action, it is too late to move to reconsider the vote on the motion to
appeal.
5. No member shall speak more than twice unless by leave of the Senate.  (See
Senate Rule 6.7; See also Note 3, supra.)
6. If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules of the Senate,
the presiding officer shall, or any member may, call him to order.  (Senate Rule 6.3)
7. An affirmative vote on this motion cannot be reconsidered.
8. Cannot be reconsidered when in committee.  Senate Rule 13.11 sets forth
procedures to effect a mandatory report by committee or discharge and recommittal.
9. A matter of right; it would require a vote equivalent to a suspension of the rules
to proceed otherwise.
10. The previous question on the entire subject matter, if  adopted, cuts off debate
and brings the Senate to a vote on the pending questions in their order until the main
question is reached, which shall be at once disposed of.  But its only effect, if a motion
&quot;to postpone&quot; is pending, is to bring the Senate to a vote upon that motion.
11. Can be moved and entered on the record when another has the floor, but cannot
interrupt business then before the Senate; must be made as provided in Senate Rule 11.12.
12. A matter of right, except in the case of the motion to  reconsider.  (See Senate
Rule 11.2)
13. A rejected motion, although it is of a class that cannot be reconsidered,
nonetheless can be renewed after progress in debate or the transaction of any business, if
the renewal is not dilatory.
14. Not in order more than once during debate on any one bill or resolution except
with unanimous consent of those present and voting.</p>
