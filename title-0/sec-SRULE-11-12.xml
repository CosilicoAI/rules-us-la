            <p>When a motion has been made and carried in the affirmative or negative, it shall be in order for any senator who voted on the side that prevailed to move for the reconsideration thereof and, if the motion was on the question of the passage or adoption of or the concurrence in any legislative instrument, or the adoption of a conference committee report on a legislative instrument, any senator who voted thereon may offer a motion for reconsideration. However, if the motion was on the question of the passage or adoption of or the concurrence in any legislative instrument, or the adoption of a conference committee report on a legislative instrument, and the motion was adopted, the member who offered the motion so adopted shall be recognized first to offer a motion to reconsider such motion and to lay the motion to reconsider on the table. No motion to reconsider a vote which has been reconsidered previously shall be in order at any time.</p>

            <p>To be in order, the motion to reconsider shall be made and, subject to the provisions of Paragraph C, shall be disposed of on the same day the original motion was adopted or rejected and when the motion otherwise is in order. A subsidiary motion may not be reconsidered after the disposition of the main motion, unless the latter has been reconsidered, nor shall the motion to reconsider the vote on the passage or adoption of or the concurrence in any instrument be in order after the instrument has gone out of the possession of the Senate.</p>

            <p>The motion to reconsider the vote on the question of the passage or adoption of or concurrence in a legislative instrument, if such instrument is not passed, adopted, or concurred in, may not be laid on the table at the time the motion is made and shall lie over until the appropriate order of business for reconsideration after the Morning Hour of the legislative day following the day on which the motion to reconsider is made, if the proponent of the motion gives notice that he will, on the next legislative day, insist on the motion to reconsider. The motion then shall be called for consideration after the Morning Hour on the next legislative day. At such time, a motion to table the motion to reconsider shall not be in order.</p>
