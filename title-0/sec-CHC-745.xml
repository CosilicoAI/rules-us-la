            <p>An informal family services plan agreement shall not be considered an adjudication.  Evidence of the existence of such an agreement shall not be used against the child, the caretaker, or other family member over objection in any adjudication hearing or criminal trial.  Such evidence may, however, be used in a disposition hearing in the juvenile court or for the purpose of a presentence investigation after a criminal conviction.</p>

            <p>An informal family services plan agreement suspends the proceedings on the conduct alleged in a family in need of services complaint or petition.  If any of the terms of the agreement are violated, the case may proceed to an adjudication hearing on the allegations.  If the child, caretaker, or other family member satisfies the terms of the agreement, he shall be discharged from further services or supervision, and the pending complaint or petition shall be dismissed with prejudice.</p>

            <p>Any incriminating statement made by the child, caretaker, or other family member during discussions or conferences incident to the informal family services plan agreement shall not be used against the declarant, over objection, in an adjudication hearing or criminal trial.  Any such statement may be reported as the basis for a referral to the local child protection unit of the Department of Children and Family Services in accordance with Article 610, if it causes the intake officer to believe that a child's physical or mental health or welfare is endangered by abuse or neglect.  Any such statement may be used in a disposition hearing in the juvenile court or for the purpose of a presentence investigation after a criminal conviction.</p>
