fact that the judge is a citizen of the state or a resident of the political subdivision, or pays
taxes thereto, is not a ground for recusal.  In any cause in which a religious body or religious
corporation is interested, the fact that a judge is a member of the religious body or religious
corporation is not alone a ground for recusal.</p>
