If part of the sentence contains an order for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening acts or harassment against, contact or communication with, or physical proximity to, another person in order to prevent domestic abuse or dating violence, the judge shall cause to have prepared a Uniform Abuse Prevention Order, as provided in R.S. 46:2136.2(C), shall sign such order, and shall immediately forward it to the clerk of court for filing on the day that the order is issued.  The clerk of the issuing court shall transmit the Uniform Abuse Prevention Order to the Judicial Administrator's Office, Louisiana Supreme Court, for entry into the Louisiana Protective Order Registry, as provided in R.S. 46:2136.2(A), by facsimile transmission or direct electronic input as expeditiously as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day after the order is filed with the clerk of court.  The clerk of the issuing court shall also send a copy of the Uniform Abuse Prevention Order, as provided in R.S. 46:2136.2(C), or any modification thereof, to the chief law enforcement officer of the parish where the person or persons protected by the order reside by facsimile transmission or direct electronic input as expeditiously as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day after the order is filed with the clerk of court.  A copy of the Uniform Abuse Prevention Order shall be retained on file in the office of the chief law enforcement officer until otherwise directed by the court.</p>
