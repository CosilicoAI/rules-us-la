            <p>Unless otherwise stipulated or as provided in Article 1455, objections are considered reserved until trial or other use of the deposition.  A party may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation on evidence imposed by the court, to prevent harassing or repetitious questions, or to prevent questions which seek information that is neither admissible at trial nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>

            <p>If the court finds that an objection made during a deposition taken for trial purposes is in violation of this Article, the court shall order the party in violation to pay for the editing or redacting of the transcript or video, along with any other costs or sanctions the court deems appropriate unless good cause is shown.</p>
