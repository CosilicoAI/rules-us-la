          <p>CHAPTER 3.  OBTAINING WITNESSES FROM OUTSIDE
THE STATE
Art. 741.  Method of obtaining a witness from another state
If a person in any state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within its borders to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions or grand jury investigations commenced or about to commence in this state, is a material witness in a prosecution pending in a court of record in this state, or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence, a judge of such court may issue a certificate under the seal of the court stating these facts and specifying the number of days the witness shall be required.  This certificate shall be presented to a judge of a court of record in the county (parish) in which the witness is found.
If the certificate recommends that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to assure his attendance in this state, the judge may direct that the witness be forthwith brought before him.  The judge being satisfied of the desirability of custody and delivery, for which determination the certificate shall be prima facie proof, may order that the witness be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of this state.  The order shall be sufficient authority for the officer to take the witness into custody and hold him unless and until he may be released by bail, recognizance, or order of the judge issuing the certificate.
If the witness is summoned to attend and testify in this state he shall be tendered the sum of ten cents a mile for each mile and five dollars for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a witness.  A witness who has appeared in accordance with the provisions of the summons shall not be required to remain within the state a longer period of time than the period mentioned in the certificate, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  If the witness fails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record of this state.</p>
