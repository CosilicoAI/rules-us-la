          <p>Rule 11.6.1. Motion to limit debate; interruption of speaker; vote
A motion to limit debate while a speaker has the floor, thereby limiting the amount of time a speaker, including the speaker who has the floor at the adoption of the motion, may exercise on the question under debate, shall only be in order as provided for herein, except when the main question has been ordered. At any time a motion is signed by twenty-six members to limit debate while a speaker has the floor and is presented to the presiding officer of the senate, such officer shall instruct the secretary of the senate to note the time of receipt of such motion. The presiding officer shall announce to the senate the receipt of the signed motion upon a point of information raised by a member. A motion to limit debate while a speaker has the floor shall be in order one hour after the announcement of the receipt of the signed motion. The motion to limit debate while a speaker has the floor, shall be decided without debate. In putting the question on the motion to limit debate while a speaker has the floor, or for a motion to remove the limitation, twenty-six Senators shall have to vote in the affirmative for either motion to be adopted. Thereafter, no senator shall be entitled to speak in all more than one hour on the measure.
