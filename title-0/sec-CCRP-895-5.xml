            <p>Restitution recovery division.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, each district attorney may establish a special division in the office designated as the
&quot;restitution recovery division&quot; for the administration, collection, and enforcement of victim
restitution, victim compensation assessments, probation fees, and payments in civil or
criminal proceedings ordered by the court and payable to the state or to crime victims,
judgments entered which have not been otherwise vacated, or judicial relief given from the
operation of the order or judgment.</p>

            <p>Notification to district attorneys of nonpayment of restitution.  The Department
of Public Safety and Corrections, division of probation and parole, may notify the district
attorney in writing when any probation fees, victim's restitution, victim's compensation, or
like payments to any civil or criminal proceeding ordered by the court to be paid to the
division have not been paid or are in default for a period of ninety days or more, and the
default has not been vacated.  Upon written notification to the district attorney, the restitution
recovery division of the office of the district attorney may collect or enforce the collection
of any funds that have not been paid or that are in default which, at the discretion of the
district attorney, are appropriate to be processed.</p>
