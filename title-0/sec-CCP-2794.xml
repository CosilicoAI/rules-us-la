            <p>When confirmed, the registered support order shall be enforced in the same manner as a support order issued by the registering court.  It is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for enforcing or staying as a support order of the rendering court.</p>

            <p>At a hearing to enforce a confirmed registered support order for enforcement, the obligor may present matters that would be available to him as defenses in an action to enforce the support order in the rendering court.  If he shows to the court that an appeal from the order is pending or will be taken or that a stay of execution has been granted, the court shall stay enforcement of the order until the appeal has been concluded, the time for appeal has expired, or the stay order has been vacated, upon satisfactory proof that the obligor has furnished security for payment of the support ordered as required by the rendering court.  If he shows to the court any ground upon which enforcement of the confirmed registered support order may be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the order for an appropriate period if the obligor furnishes the security for payment of the support ordered that is required by law.
