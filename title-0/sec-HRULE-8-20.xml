            <p>A legislative instrument may be returned to the calendar upon approval of a majority of the members present and voting.  Only a member authoring the instrument, or the member handling the instrument if it originated in the Senate, or another member authorized by the author of a House Bill or member handling a Senate Bill, may move to call it from the calendar for further action or consideration.  For instruments advanced to third reading, returned from the Senate with amendments for concurrence, or reported from a conference committee, an instrument may be called from the calendar no sooner than the next legislative day following the member's notifying the House of his intention to call an instrument from the calendar.  No notice of intention to call from the calendar shall be required for a bill returned to the calendar on the last day for final passage of bills or for an instrument reported from a conference committee which was returned to the calendar on the last day of a session.</p>

            <p>Each instrument for which notice has been given pursuant to this Rule shall be listed on the Order of the Day in the order the Clerk received the member's notice.  Such instruments shall remain so listed until the author or member authorized to handle the instrument is recognized to move to call the instrument from the calendar, which recognition shall be made in the order the instrument is listed on the Order of the Day.  On the day prior to such recognition, the Speaker shall announce to the House notice of his intention to recognize members to call such instruments.  If the author or member authorized to handle the instrument chooses not to move to call the instrument or if the House refuses to grant the member permission to call the instrument at the time the member is called upon to make such motion, the instrument shall be removed from the list and returned to its numerical order in the listing of instruments returned to the calendar.  The author or member authorized to handle the instrument so returned may give later notice to the Clerk of his intention to call the instrument from the calendar pursuant to Paragraph A.
