            <p>At any time between regular sessions of the legislature, but not later than five in
the evening of the forty-fifth calendar day prior to the first day of a regular session for bills
and joint resolutions relative to retirement, members of the House may prefile with the Clerk
legislative instruments, including bills, joint resolutions, and simple and concurrent
resolutions, which are proposed for introduction at either of the next two regular sessions. 
However, no instrument shall be prefiled by a member during the period between the
convening of the last regular session prior to each general election for members of the
legislature and the certification of election of such member to the House, and no instrument
shall be prefiled for the next regular session after such general election prior to such time. 
After a person is certified as elected to the House, such member or member-elect may prefile
instruments for introduction at the next regular session.  The member, member-elect, or
designee of such person, shall deliver such instruments to the Clerk in the requisite number
of copies for introduction.  In accordance with House Rule 7.3, the Clerk shall number each
prefiled instrument in the order in which they are received.  The Clerk shall cause all prefiled
bills to be printed or otherwise made available for distribution and shall otherwise process
all prefiled instruments for introduction when the session for which they are prefiled
convenes.</p>

            <p>The Speaker shall refer each prefiled instrument to the appropriate standing
committee under the provisions of House Rule 6.6. At the time of such referral the Speaker
shall notify the author of the referral of such instrument, naming the committee to which the
instrument has been referred.  Such referral, the date thereof, and the name of the committee
of reference shall be entered in the Interim Calendar.  The committee referral of an
instrument prefiled within one week preceding the convening of the session for which it shall
be introduced shall not be entered in the Interim Calendar.  If any member of the House of
Representatives notifies the Speaker in writing, within five days of publication in the Interim
Calendar of such referral and distribution of such Calendar as provided in House Rule 12.7,
that he objects to the instrument's being considered or heard by such committee and states
the reason for his objection, the House and Governmental Affairs Committee shall determine
the committee to which the instrument shall be referred.  No prefiled legislative instrument
about which such objection has been raised shall be considered or heard by the House and
Governmental Affairs Committee for purposes of referral unless and until the objector to the
referral and the author of said instrument have been notified of the meeting at which such
referral is to be considered, such notice to be by letter mailed seven days in advance of the
meeting.  The author of any prefiled instrument which has been referred to committee prior
to the session, or any member of the House of Representatives, unless such instrument has
been considered by the committee of reference and such committee has determined its report
on  the instrument as provided in House Rule 6.11, may, at the time of formal referral of such
instrument during the session, offer a motion for referral of the instrument to a different
committee; however, if the motion is made by a member other than</p>

            <p>The Clerk shall retain the original and such number of copies of the prefiled
instrument as are necessary for introduction when the session convenes, but shall transmit
exact copies thereof to the committee of reference.  A prefiled instrument may be withdrawn
by its author at any time prior to introduction upon written request by the author to the Clerk,
who shall reclaim such instrument from the committee of reference.  Such withdrawal shall
be entered in the Interim Calendar.</p>

            <p>Standing committees may but shall not be required to hold hearings and consider
prefiled instruments referred to them prior to the session, except as provided in Paragraph
B above.  However, no meeting shall be held for the consideration or hearing of an
instrument prior to the third Monday in January immediately prior to the session in which
the instrument shall be introduced or  prior to five days after distribution of the Interim
Calendar in which the entry indicating the referral of such instrument to such committee by
the Speaker appears.  If any member objects to its referral as provided in Paragraph B hereof,
such meeting shall not be held prior to five days after the distribution of the Interim Calendar
in which the entry indicating the referral of such instrument by the House and Governmental
Affairs Committee appears.  In its discretion, a committee may determine, prior to the
session and in accordance with the rules of the House, the report it will make on the
instrument during the session in which the instrument shall be introduced.  The committee
shall file such reports with the Clerk.</p>

            <p>Each prefiled instrument shall be introduced on the first day of the session as
required by the Constitution and by the rules of the House.  In the case of prefiled
instruments which have been referred to committee prior to the session, the Journal shall
recite the committee reference on the day of introduction.  At such time the author, or, if the
author is present in the chamber, any other member, may offer a motion for reference of the
instrument to a different committee, as provided in House Rule 6.5, unless the committee to
which it was referred has determined its report on the prefiled instrument.  However, the
motion for reference of the instrument to a different committee shall not be in order unless
the chairman of the committee of original referral is present in the chamber at the time the
motion is made.  If the committee report has been determined in accordance with House Rule
6.11, the author or any other member may move to discharge the committee from further
consideration of the instrument in accordance with House Rule 6.13.</p>
