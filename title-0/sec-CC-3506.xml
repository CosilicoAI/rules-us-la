            <p>Successor. A successor is a person who takes the place of another.  There are two
kinds of successors:  the universal successor, such as the heir, universal legatee, and general
legatee; and the particular successor, such as the buyer, donee, or particular legatee.  The
universal successor represents the person of the deceased and succeeds to his rights and
charges.  The particular successor succeeds only to the rights appertaining to the thing that
is sold, donated, or bequeathed, or otherwise transferred to him.</p>

            <p>Third person.  A third person is a person who is not a party to a ceremony, an
instrument, a juridical act, a judgment, or a legal relationship.  Examples of third persons
include officiants to ceremonies, witnesses to instruments or juridical acts, and all those other
than obligor and obligee to the legal relationship between the former and the latter.  With
respect to an obligation, a third person does not include a person such as a universal
successor or a person who assumes the obligation or is bound by contract to recognize it.
