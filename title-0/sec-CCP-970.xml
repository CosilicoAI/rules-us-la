            <p>After an opportunity for adequate discovery, but not less than twenty days before
the time specified for the trial of the matter, without any admission of liability, any party may
serve upon an adverse party an offer of judgment for the purpose of settling all of the claims
between them. The offer of judgment shall be in writing and state that it is made under this
Article; specify the total amount of money of the settlement offer; and specify whether that
amount is inclusive or exclusive of costs, interest, attorney fees, and any other amount which
may be awarded pursuant to statute or rule. Unless accepted, an offer of judgment shall
remain confidential between the offeror and offeree. If the adverse party, within ten days
after service, serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may move for
judgment on the offer. The court shall grant such judgment on the motion of either party.</p>

            <p>If the final judgment obtained by the plaintiff-offeree is at least twenty-five percent
less than the amount of the offer of judgment made by the defendant-offeror, or if the final
judgment obtained against the defendant-offeree is at least twenty-five percent greater than
the amount of the offer of judgment made by the plaintiff-offeror, or if the final judgment is
in favor of the defendant-offeror, the offeree must pay the offeror's costs, exclusive of
attorney fees, incurred after the offer was made, as fixed by the court.</p>

            <p>The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent
offer or a counter offer.  When the liability of one party to another has been determined by
verdict, order, or judgment, but the amount or extent of the damages remains to be
determined by future proceedings, either party may make an offer of judgment, which shall
have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not
less than thirty days before the start of hearings to determine the amount or extent of
damages.</p>

            <p>For purposes of comparing the amount of money offered in the offer of judgment
to the final judgment obtained, which judgment shall take into account any additur or
remittitur, the final judgment obtained shall not include any amounts attributable to costs,
interest, or attorney fees, or to any other amount which may be awarded pursuant to statute
or rule, unless such amount was expressly included in the offer.</p>

            <p>A judgment granted on a motion for judgment on an offer of judgment is a final
judgment when signed by the judge; however, an appeal cannot be taken by a party who has
consented to the judgment.</p>
