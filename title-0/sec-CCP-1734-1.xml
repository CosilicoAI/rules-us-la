            <p>When the case has been set for trial, the court may order, in lieu of the bond
required in Article 1734, a deposit for costs, which shall be a specific amount estimated by
the court, and the court shall fix the time for making the deposit, which shall be no later than
thirty days prior to trial. The deposit shall include sufficient funds for payment of all costs
associated with a jury trial, including juror fees and expenses and charges of the jury
commission, clerk of court, and sheriff. The required deposit shall not exceed five thousand
dollars for the first day, and one thousand dollars per day for each additional day the court
estimates the trial will last. Notice of the fixing of the deposit shall be served on all parties.
If the deposit is not timely made, any other party shall have an additional ten days to make
the required deposit. Failure to post the deposit shall constitute a waiver of a trial by jury.
However, no deposit shall be required of an applicant for a jury trial under the provisions of
this Article if waived or an order is rendered, pursuant to Chapter 5 of Title I of Book IX of
this Code, permitting the applicant to litigate or continue to litigate without payment of costs
in advance or furnishing security therefor.</p>
