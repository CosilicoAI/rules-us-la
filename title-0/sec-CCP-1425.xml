and reasons therefor and the data or other information considered by the witness in forming
the opinions.  The parties, upon agreement, or if ordered by the court, shall include in the
report any or all of the following: exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the
opinions; the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored by the
