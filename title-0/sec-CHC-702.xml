                <p>In the case of a child under the age of six, the court may find that continuation
of the child's placement with the current caregiver is in the child's best interest if the child
is in a stable home environment where the child's physical and emotional needs are met by
a person who has a significant relationship with the child, that no relative or other suitable
caregiver has been identified as a concurrent plan caregiver as part of the child's case plan
or report submitted to the court, and that it would be detrimental to the child's well-being if
the child is removed from the current caregiver. Upon such finding, the department shall not
make any change in placement absent prior written notice to the court. Prior notice for a
placement change is not required when necessary to ensure the safety of the child, when the
current caregiver requests that the child be removed, or when a child is moving to the home
of a parent for the purpose of a trial placement.</p>
