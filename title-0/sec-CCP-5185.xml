                <p>The right to the compulsory attendance of not more than six witnesses for the
purpose of testifying, either in court or by deposition, without the payment of the fees,
mileage, and other expenses allowed these witnesses by law.  If a party has been permitted
to litigate without full payment of costs and is unable to pay for witnesses desired by the
party, in addition to those summoned at the expense of the parish, the party shall make a
sworn application to the court for the additional witnesses.  The application shall allege that
the testimony is relevant and material and not cumulative and that the defendant cannot
safely go to trial without it.  A short summary of the expected testimony of each witness shall
be attached to the application.</p>

witnesses at the expense of the parish.  If the application is denied, the court shall state the
reasons for the denial in writing, which shall become part of the record.</p>
