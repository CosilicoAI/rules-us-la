            <p>No judgment of disposition shall remain in force for a period exceeding the
maximum term of imprisonment for the offense which forms the basis for the adjudication,
except that if the child is placed on probation, the term of probation may extend for a
maximum of one year, or for such longer period of time as the child is a full-time participant
in a juvenile drug court program operated by a court of this state, if such participation has
been ordered by the court as a condition of the child's probation.  The court shall give a child
credit for time spent in secure detention prior to the imposition of disposition.</p>
