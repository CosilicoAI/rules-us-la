            <p>The chairman of each standing committee shall post notice of each session
committee meeting on bulletin boards in the lobbies of the House and Senate no later than
4:00 o'clock p.m. or one hour after the House convenes in the afternoon, whichever is later,
on the legislative day preceding the meeting.  A copy of the notice shall also be filed at the
same time with the Clerk of the House.  This notice shall adhere to the weekly committee
schedule previously submitted to the Clerk; however the committee shall not be required to
list each legislative instrument on its weekly schedule on its notice.  Any legislative
instrument listed on the weekly schedule and listed on the notice for a committee which was
not disposed of at the first meeting of a committee in the week may be carried over and listed
on the notice for the second meeting of the committee during such week.
