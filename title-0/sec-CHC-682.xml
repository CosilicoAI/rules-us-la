            <p>The court shall not remove a child from the custody of the parent unless
continuation in the home would be contrary to the health, welfare, and safety of the child and
the health, welfare, and safety of the child cannot, in the opinion of the court, be adequately
secured without removal.  Except as otherwise provided in Article 672.1, in support of any
disposition removing a child from the parental home, the court shall determine whether the
department has made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the
child and, after removal, to reunify the parent and child or to finalize placement in an
alternative safe and permanent home in accordance with the permanent plan including, if
appropriate, through an interstate placement.  The health, welfare, and safety of the child
shall be the paramount concern in the court's consideration of removal.  The department shall
have the burden of demonstrating reasonable efforts.</p>
