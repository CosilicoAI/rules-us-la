          <p>Art. 101.  Preamble
The people of Louisiana recognize the family as the most fundamental unit of human
society; that preserving families is essential to a free society; that the relationship between
parent and child is preeminent in establishing and maintaining the well-being of the child;
that parents have the responsibility for providing the basic necessities of life as well as love
and affection to their children; that parents have the paramount right to raise their children
in accordance with their own values and traditions; that parents should make the decisions
regarding where and with whom the child shall reside, the educational, moral, ethical, and
religious training of the child, the medical, psychiatric, surgical, and preventive health care
of the child, and the discipline of the child; that children owe to their parents respect,
obedience, and affection; that the role of the state in the family is limited and should only be
asserted when there is a serious threat to the family, the parents, or the child; and that
extraordinary procedures established by law are meant to be used only when required by
necessity, and then with due respect for the rights of the parents, the children, and the
institution of the family, and only to the extent that such procedures are not prohibited by the
Louisiana Constitution of 1974, as amended.</p>
