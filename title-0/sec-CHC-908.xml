            <p>The department shall ensure that a child has a certified birth certificate and valid
six-year identification card or submit all necessary applications, records, and fees to obtain
those records within thirty days from when a child is committed to the custody of the
department.  The department shall ensure that a child has both a certified copy of the child's
birth certificate and a valid state identification card upon release from custody.  Failure of
the department to obtain these records shall not prevent a child's release from custody.
