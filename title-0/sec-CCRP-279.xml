            <p>Whenever a person has been released on bail pursuant to a commercial surety bond and is subsequently located in another state, the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in having that person returned to the parish in which charges are pending against him, whether through extradition proceedings or otherwise, shall be paid by the commercial surety provided that the surety was given notice of extradition or waiver of extradition and was provided seventy-two hours to return the person to the parish at his cost.  Payment of these expenses shall be due within thirty days after written notice thereof has been given to the surety at the address provided pursuant to Code of Criminal Procedure Article 322.  The commercial surety shall not be relieved of his obligation on the bond until the commercial surety has paid said reasonable and necessary costs for the return of the wanted person.</p>
