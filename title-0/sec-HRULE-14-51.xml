          <p>Rule 14.51.  Standing committees; subpoena power, punishment for contempt
Each standing committee established by House Rule 6.1, each joint committee established pursuant to the authority granted in House Rule 14.16, and any subcommittee of such standing or joint committee is hereby specifically and expressly granted the power and authority to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, require the production of books and records, and to do all other things necessary to accomplish the purposes of the study or investigation assigned to it by the House or by the legislature or by a majority of the members of the committee.  However, a subpoena or a subpoena duces tecum shall be issued only upon the approval of the Speaker upon the request of the chairman of the committee or upon the request of a majority of the members of the standing committee.  The chairman of the committee or a majority of the members of the committee, as the case may be, shall submit sufficient information to the Speaker to justify the issuance of the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum which shall include a description in general terms of the proceeding for which the issuance of the subpoena is sought; in the case of process to secure the attendance and testimony of a witness, the reasons for believing that the testimony of the witness is relevant to the proceeding; in the case of process to secure the production of books or records, the reasons for believing such materials are relevant to the proceeding; in either such instance a subpoena is sought, the reasons why a subpoena is necessary to obtain such attendance, testimony, or materials; and any other information the Speaker deems necessary.  In the event a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is not honored, such committees shall have the power to punish for contempt.  In addition, such committees shall have the power to provide for the prosecution of any individual for refusal to testify, false swearing, or perjury before the committee in accordance with the laws of this state.
