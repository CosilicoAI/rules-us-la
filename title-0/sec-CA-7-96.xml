          <p>THE JUVENILE COURT
§96.  Establishment; jurisdiction; appeals; procedure; judges
Section 96.  Parish of Orleans--Jurisdiction--Appeals--Procedure--Judge--Salary and term of office.  There shall be a Juvenile Court for the
Parish of Orleans, which shall have jurisdiction, except for capital crimes and
crimes defined by any law defining attempted aggravated rape committed by
children fifteen years of age or older, of proceedings concerning neglected or
delinquent children under seventeen years of age.  The court shall also have
jurisdiction of all cases of desertion or nonsupport of children by either parent,
or of nonsupport of wives by their husbands and also of the adoption of
children under seventeen years of age.  Upon the effective date of this
amendment the Juvenile Courts shall be divested of jurisdiction and trial of all
persons charged with contributing to the neglect or delinquency of children
under seventeen years of age, and all persons charged with the violation of any
law now in existence or hereafter enacted for the protection of the physical,
moral or mental well-being of children under seventeen years of age, not
punishable by death or hard labor, the jurisdiction and trial of all persons so
charged is hereby vested in the Criminal District Court for the Parish of
Orleans.  All such cases, pending and undisposed of, and the records thereof
upon the effective date of this amendment, shall be transferred, by order of a
Juvenile Court judge to the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans
for further proceedings in accordance with law, and such transfer shall be
deemed perfected upon the signing of such order.
Appeals shall lie to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana from
all final judgments rendered by the Juvenile Court.  An appeal shall lie on
questions of law and of fact when the judgment of the court affects the
custody, care or control of children under seventeen years of age, but such
appeal shall not discharge the child to whom said judgment relates from the
custody of the Juvenile Court or of the person, institution or agency to whose
care such child may be committed by the Juvenile Court, unless the Supreme
Court shall so order.  An appeal also shall lie on questions of law and of fact
in adoption proceedings.  In all other cases an appeal shall lie on questions of
law alone.
The Legislature shall have power to regulate the manner of conducting
all proceedings in said Juvenile Court and appeals from all final judgments,
and the number and duties of the officers thereof and all other matters
pertaining thereto.  Proceedings in the Juvenile Court concerning neglected or
delinquent children under seventeen years of age are not required to be
instituted by indictment, information or affidavit.
The judges of the Juvenile Court for the Parish of Orleans shall try
cases and consider all matters coming before said court.  The legislature by a
two-thirds vote of the membership of each house shall fix the salary and the
number of judges of the Juvenile Court for the Parish of Orleans.  The terms
of office of said judges shall be eight years.  The judges of the Juvenile Court
for the Parish of Orleans shall be elected by the qualified electors of the Parish
of Orleans.  They shall be learned in the law and shall have practiced law in
this state for not less than five years previous to their election and shall have
resided in the Parish of Orleans for at least two years immediately preceding
their election.  The successors to the judges of said court at the time of the
final adoption of this amendment to the Constitution shall be elected at the
respective nearest Congressional elections preceding the expiration of the
respective terms of office of such judges.  Whenever a judge of the Juvenile
Court for the Parish of Orleans is prevented from holding court for any cause
whatever, and that fact is made to appear by a certificate from a judge of said
Juvenile Court or Clerk of said Juvenile Court to the Supreme Court or any
Justice thereof, the public interest so requiring, the Supreme Court, in its
supervisory powers, may assign any district judge or appoint any lawyer
having the same qualifications for judge of the Juvenile Court to hold court
and discharge the duties of said Judge of the Juvenile Court.  Any lawyer thus
designated and appointed shall be paid in the same manner as the salary of the
judges of the Juvenile Court for the Parish of Orleans.  Prior acts of the
Legislature, including those which it may have enacted at its regular session
in 1968, pertaining to the salary and the number of judges of the Juvenile
Court for the Parish of Orleans are hereby ratified and confirmed.
