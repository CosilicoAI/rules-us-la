            <p>Except as otherwise provided by law, the relationship between interdict and
curator is the same as that between minor and tutor.  The rules provided by Articles 4261
through 4269, 4270 through 4274, 4301 through 4342, and 4371 apply to curatorship of
interdicts.  Nevertheless, provisions establishing special rules for natural tutors and parents
shall not apply in the context of interdiction.</p>

            <p>A curator who owns an interest in property with the interdict or who holds a
security interest or lien that encumbers the property of the interdict may acquire the property,
or any interest therein, from the interdict upon compliance with Article 4271, with prior court
authorization, and when it would be in the best interest of the interdict.  Except for good
cause shown, the court shall appoint an independent appraiser to value the interest to be
acquired by the curator.</p>

provisions of Article 4269.1. Except for trusts qualified under 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(A) or
1396p(d)(4)(C), the trust shall be subject to termination at the option of the interdict upon
termination of the interdiction. If the interdict dies during the interdiction, the trust shall be
subject to termination at the option of his heirs or legatees.</p>
