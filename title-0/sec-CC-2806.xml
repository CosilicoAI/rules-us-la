any capacity for and in the name of any partnership that has not been created by contract as
required by law, and the partnership is subsequently created by contract in accordance with
this Title, the partnership's existence shall be retroactive to the date of acquisition of an
interest in the immovable property, but the retroactive effect shall be without prejudice to
rights validly acquired by third persons in the interim between the date of acquisition and the
date that the partnership was created by contract.</p>
