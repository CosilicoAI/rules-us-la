            <p>The court shall not order the production or inspection of any writing, or
electronically stored information, obtained or prepared by the adverse party, his attorney,
surety, indemnitor, or agent in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial unless
satisfied that denial of production or inspection will unfairly prejudice the party seeking the
production or inspection in preparing his claim or defense or will cause him undue hardship
or injustice.  Except as otherwise provided in Article 1425(E)(1), the court shall not order
the production or inspection of any part of the writing, or electronically stored information,
that reflects the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or theories of an attorney.</p>

            <p>When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under these rules by
claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation material, the party
shall make the claim expressly and shall prepare and send to the other parties a privilege log
that describes the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or
disclosed in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will
enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.</p>

            <p>A disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client
privilege or work product protection does not operate as a waiver if the disclosure is
inadvertent and is made in connection with litigation or administrative proceedings, and if
the person entitled to assert the privilege or work product protection took reasonably prompt
measures, once the holder knew of the disclosure, to notify the receiving party of the
inadvertence of the disclosure and the privilege asserted.  Once notice is received, the
receiving party shall either return or promptly safeguard the inadvertently disclosed material,
but with the option of asserting a waiver.  Even without notice of the inadvertent disclosure
from the sending party, if it is clear that the material received is privileged and inadvertently
produced, the receiving party shall either return or promptly safeguard the material, and shall
notify the sending party of the material received, but with the option of asserting a waiver.</p>
