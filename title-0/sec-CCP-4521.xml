a judgment or settlement, the court may order:</p>

              <p>That the funds be paid directly into the registry of the court for the minor's
account, to be withdrawn only upon approval of the court.  Withdrawn funds shall be
invested directly in an interest-bearing investment as approved by the court unless the court
for good cause approves another disposition.</p>

              <p>That the funds be placed in trust in accordance with the Louisiana Trust Code or,
for a beneficiary who is disabled as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3), in a trust qualified
under 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(C) in accordance with the law of any state. The trust instrument
shall name the minor as sole beneficiary of the trust, shall name a trustee, shall impose
maximum spendthrift restraints, and may allow the trust to last for the lifetime of the
beneficiary. Except for trusts qualified under 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(A) or 1396p(d)(4)(C),
the trust shall, however, be subject to termination at the option of the beneficiary upon
attaining the age of majority. If the minor fails to attain majority, the trust shall be subject
to termination at the option of his heirs or legatees. The court shall not order funds that will
be paid to an unemancipated minor who is in the legal custody of the Department of Children
and Family Services to be placed in trust if the amount of the judgment or settlement is less
than fifty thousand dollars.</p>
