            <p>When the sheriff has not made service within ten days after receipt of the process
or when a return has been made certifying that the sheriff has been unable to make service,
whichever is earlier, on motion of a party the court shall appoint a person over the age of
majority, not a party and residing within the state whom the court deems qualified to perform
the duties required, to make service of process in the same manner as is required of sheriffs. 
Service of process made in this manner shall be proved like any other fact in the case.  Any
person who is a Louisiana licensed private investigator shall be presumed qualified to
perform the duties required to make service.</p>

            <p>In serving notice of a summary proceeding as provided by Article 2592 or a
subpoena which is related to the proceeding, on motion of a party the court shall have the
discretion to appoint any person over the age of majority, not a party and residing within the
state, to make service of process, notices, and subpoenas in the same manner as is required
of sheriffs, without first requiring the sheriff to attempt service.  The party making such a
motion shall include the reasons, verified by affidavit, necessary to forego service by the
sheriff, which shall include but not be limited to the urgent emergency nature of the hearing,
knowledge of the present whereabouts of the person to be served, as well as any other good
cause shown.</p>

of process pursuant to Paragraph A or B of this Article, the court may also appoint a juridical
person which may then select an employee or agent of that juridical person to make service
of process, provided the employee or agent perfecting service of process is a natural person
who qualifies as an agent for service of process pursuant to Paragraph A or B of this Article.</p>

other process is a temporary restraining order, protective order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction, or court-approved consent agreement as referenced in R.S.
46:2136.2(B), the person making the service, or his designee, shall transmit proof of service
to the judicial administrator's office, Louisiana Supreme Court, for entry into the Louisiana
Protective Order Registry, as provided in R.S. 46:2136.2(A), by facsimile transmission or
direct electronic input as expeditiously as possible, but no later than the end of the next
business day after making service, exclusive of weekends and holidays.  This proof shall
include, at a minimum, the case caption, docket number, type of order, serving agency and
officer, and the date and time service was made.</p>
