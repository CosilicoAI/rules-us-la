of the obligations secured by the superior encumbrance, as of the scheduled date of the
sheriff's sale. The subpoena duces tecum shall be served on the owner or servicer of the
superior encumbrance at least fourteen calendar days before the response is due, and shall
be made returnable at least seven calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the sheriff's
sale, at the office of the sheriff or at the office of the seizing creditor or its attorney. If the
