            <p>The criminal sheriff of the parish of Orleans and all other sheriffs throughout the state are hereby authorized to make service of subpoenas to law enforcement officers through the law enforcement officer's ranking officers or their designated representative, which, upon service thereof, shall have the same legal effect as if domiciliary service had been made upon the law enforcement officer named therein.  This service shall be made at the district stations or departmental headquarters of said law enforcement agency.  Service may consist of individual subpoenas or may consist of lists which include officer's name and badge number, case title, name of court, and date of commanded appearance.  Such lists may be served by the sheriff or his deputies by means of electronic transfer to printing devices located in the district stations or departmental headquarters.  The ranking officer, or his designated representative, shall sign for such subpoenas or indicate receipt by electronic verification code, and shall be required to notify the law enforcement officer named therein of receipt of the subpoenas or list.</p>
