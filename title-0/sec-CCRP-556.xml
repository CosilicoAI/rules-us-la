in any other applicable law, in a misdemeanor case, if the defendant is not represented by

charge and of his right to be represented by counsel.</p>

            <p>In a misdemeanor case in which the court determines that a sentence of
imprisonment will actually be imposed or in which the conviction can be used to enhance
the grade or statutory penalty for a subsequent offense, the court shall not accept a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally in open court and
informing him of, and determining that he understands, all of the following:</p>

              <p>If the defendant is not represented by an attorney, that he has the right to be
