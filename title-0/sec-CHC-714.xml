            <p>The court may modify a judgment of disposition on its own motion or on the motion of the district attorney, the department, the child, or his parents.  When a child has been committed to a mental hospital, psychiatric unit, or substance abuse facility, the court may modify the judgment of disposition, for good cause shown, on the filing of a proper motion by the director of the mental hospital, psychiatric unit, or substance abuse facility.

              <p>A motion to modify a judgment of disposition may be denied without a contradictory hearing, except when made by the director of a mental hospital, psychiatric unit, or substance abuse facility to which a child has been committed.  In such instances, the director shall be permitted to show that the continued commitment would not be in the child's best interest because the facility cannot provide proper treatment or that the child has received the maximum benefit from the treatment available at the facility.  The director shall make specific written recommendations regarding proper treatment or placement of the child, or both, in the motion filed with the court.  The court shall hold a hearing on the motion for modification of a disposition filed by the director of a mental health hospital, psychiatric unit, or substance abuse facility within ten days of the filing of the motion unless continued for cause shown.  An attorney from the Mental Health Advocacy Service shall be appointed to represent the child's interest at such a hearing unless attorneys from such agency are unavailable or the child has retained private counsel who shall represent only the interest of the child.</p>
