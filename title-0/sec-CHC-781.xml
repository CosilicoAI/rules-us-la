            <p>A child shall not be committed to a public or private mental institution or
institution for persons with mental illness unless the court finds, based on psychological or
psychiatric evaluation, that the child has a mental disorder, other than an intellectual
disability, that has a substantial adverse effect on the child's ability to function and requires
care and treatment in an institution.  When the child is in the custody of the state of
Louisiana, this finding shall not be made without a contradictory hearing, notice to the
Louisiana Department of Health, bureau of legal services, and representation of the child by
an attorney appointed from the Mental Health Advocacy Service, unless the child retains
private counsel, who shall represent only the interest of the child.  The Mental Health
Advocacy Service's attorney appointed shall continue to represent the child in any proceeding
relating to admission, change of status, or discharge from the mental hospital or psychiatric
unit.  Upon modification of the disposition to a placement other than a mental hospital or
psychiatric unit, the Mental Health Advocacy Service's attorney shall be relieved of
representation of the child.</p>
