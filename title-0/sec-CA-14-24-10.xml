          <p>§24.10.  New Orleans; board of liquidation of city debt; membership and
powers
Be it further enacted, etc., that the Board of Liquidation, City Debt,
established by Act No.  133, of the Acts of 1880, as now constituted, is hereby
created a body corporate, with right of existence and succession as provided
by law, with power to sue and be sued, to have a corporate seal, to make
reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of its business, and to employ
counsel and a reasonable clerical force.  None of its members shall receive any
compensation for his services.  The syndicate members of the Board of
Liquidation, City Debt, and its ex officio members, the mayor of the city of
New Orleans and Councilmen at large shall not be individually liable for any
act or omission resulting in damage or injury, arising out of the exercise of
their judgment in the formation and implementation of policy or arising out of
the direction or management of the affairs of the Board of Liquidation, City
Debt, in good faith and within the scope of their official functions and duties,
unless such damage or injury was caused by the willful or wanton misconduct
of such members.  One of its members shall be elected president, and another
vice-president, who shall act in the absence or disability of the president.  They
shall select a secretary (not a member of the board), who shall give bond for
the faithful performance of his duties in the sum of twenty thousand dollars,
and this bond shall be renewed every three years. He shall receive a salary to
be fixed by the board and shall serve at the pleasure of the board.  Their funds
shall be deposited with the fiscal agent of the city of New Orleans, or with
some chartered bank in the city of New Orleans selected by the board.  The
city of New Orleans shall provide, in the city hall or elsewhere, proper offices
and quarters for said board and its officers, books, records, and archives.  The
clerical office expenses, counsel fees, and the cost of printing and engraving
bonds under this Act shall be paid from said tax fund.  On the first of January
and July of each year, said board shall make, in printed form, to the city
council, a detailed report of all its receipts and all its expenditures, and of its
transactions and doings under the provisions of this Act, with the names of all
its employees, and the amount of compensation paid to each.  Nothing in this
Act contained shall be construed to affect or change in any manner the duties,
powers, and functions of the Board of Liquidation, City Debt, under existing
laws, not inconsistent with this Act, or the rights of said board to the assets and
property of the city not dedicated to public use, including the uncollected taxes
prior to 1879; but said duties, functions, rights, and powers are maintained and
confirmed in full force.
