          <p>Art. 725.  Reports of examinations and tests
When the court grants the relief sought by the defendant pursuant to Article 719 of this Code, it shall, upon the written motion of the state, condition its order by requiring the defendant to disclose to the state, and to permit or authorize the state, or an expert working with the state, to inspect and copy, photograph, or otherwise reproduce, and disclose to the district attorney any results of reports, or copies thereof, of physical and mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments, made in connection with the particular case, that are in the possession, custody, control, or knowledge of the defendant, and intended for use at trial.  If the witness preparing the report will be called as an expert, the report shall contain the witness's area of expertise, his qualifications, a list of materials upon which his conclusion is based, and his opinion and the reason therefor.  If the expert witness has not reduced his results or reports to writing, or if the expert witness's written report does not contain the information required of an expert as provided in this Article, the defendant must produce for the state a written summary containing any information required to be produced pursuant to this Article but absent from a written report, if any, including the name of the expert witness, his qualifications, a list of materials upon which his conclusion is based, and his opinion and the reason therefor.
