            <p>A succession representative is a fiduciary with respect to the succession, and shall

            <p>A nonresident succession representative may execute a procuration or mandate
appointing a resident of the state to represent him in all acts of his administration.  A resident
succession representative who will be absent from the state temporarily similarly may
appoint an agent to act for him during his absence.  Additionally, a succession representative
may appoint an agent to alienate, acquire, lease, or encumber specifically described property
on specific terms.  A procuration or mandate granted for this purpose may either recite the
specific terms of the transaction or state that the succession representative has approved the
terms of the transaction.  The procuration or mandate appointing the agent shall be filed in
the record of the succession proceeding and shall not need court approval.</p>
