            <p>The sheriff shall endorse on a copy of the citation or other process the date, place,
and method of service and sufficient other data to show service in compliance with law.  He
shall sign and return the copy promptly after the service to the clerk of court who issued it. 
The return, when received by the clerk, shall form part of the record, and shall be considered
prima facie correct.  The court, at any time and upon such terms as are just, may allow any
process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material
prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.</p>

            <p>In addition to the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article, when the citation or
other process is a temporary restraining order, protective order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction, or court-approved consent agreement as referenced in R.S.
46:2136.2(B), the person making the service, or his designee, shall transmit proof of service
to the judicial administrator's office, Louisiana Supreme Court, for entry into the Louisiana
Protective Order Registry, as provided in R.S. 46:2136.2(A), by facsimile transmission or
direct electronic input as expeditiously as possible, but no later than the end of the next
business day after making service, exclusive of weekends and holidays.  This proof shall
include, at a minimum, the case caption, docket number, type of order, serving agency and
officer, and the date and time service was made.</p>
