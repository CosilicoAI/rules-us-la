          <p>Art. 5156.  Effect of discussion
When discussion is pleaded successfully by a third possessor, or by the transferee in a revocatory action, the court shall stay proceedings against the third possessor or transferee until the creditor has executed his judgment against the property discussed.
When discussion is pleaded successfully by a surety and the principal is joined, the court may render judgment against both the principal and the surety, but shall order the creditor to execute his judgment against the property discussed.  If the principal is not joined in the action initially, the court shall order his joinder if he is subject to its jurisdiction, and may then proceed as provided in this paragraph.
If the creditor is not able to satisfy his judgment out of the proceeds of the judicial sale of the property discussed, he may thereafter proceed as if discussion had not been pleaded.</p>
