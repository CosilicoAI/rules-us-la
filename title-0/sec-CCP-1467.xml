          <content>
            <p>Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth.  The
matter is admitted unless, within thirty days after service of the request, or within such
shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed
serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to
the matter, signed by the party or by his attorney.  The written answer or reasons for
objection to each request for admission shall immediately follow a restatement of the request
for admission to which the answer or objection is responding.  If objection is made, the
reasons therefor shall be stated.  The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in
detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter.  A
denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith
requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an
admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the
remainder.  An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason
for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the
information known or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or
deny.  A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested
presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may,
subject to the provisions of Article 1472, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot
admit or deny it.</p>

          <content>
            <p>The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the
sufficiency of the answers or objections.  Unless the court determines that an objection is
justified, it shall order that an answer be served.  If the court determines that an answer does
not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted
or that an amended answer be served.  The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that
final disposition of the request be made at a pretrial conference or at a designated time prior
to trial.  The provisions of Article 1469 apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation
to the motion.</p>
