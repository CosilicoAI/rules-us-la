            <p>Adoption is based upon the legal termination of parental rights and
responsibilities of biological parents and the creation of the relationship of parent and child
between an adopted person and his adoptive parents.  These legal and social premises
underlying adoption shall be maintained.</p>

              <p>The legislature recognizes that some adults, adopted as children, have a strong
interest in identifying information about their biological parents or biological siblings, or
both, while other such adult adopted persons have no such interest.</p>

              <p>The legislature further recognizes that some biological parents and biological
siblings have a strong interest in identifying information about their biological children or
siblings who were surrendered for adoption, while others have no such interest.</p>

            <content>
              <p>The legislature also recognizes the potential for special situations whereby other
adoptive and biological relatives of an adopted person, such as a parent, sibling, or
descendant, or his parent if a minor, of a deceased biological parent and an adoptive parent
of a minor or deceased adopted person as well as a descendant of a deceased adopted person,
or his parent if a minor, may have a need for identifying information.</p>

family.
