            <p>When the mental or physical condition of a party, or of a person in the custody
or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is
pending may order the party to submit to an additional medical opinion regarding physical
or mental examination by a physician or to produce for examination the person in his custody
or legal control, except as provided by law.  In addition, the court may order the party to
submit to an additional medical opinion regarding an examination by a vocational
rehabilitation expert or a licensed clinical psychologist who is not a physician, provided the
party has given notice of intention to use such an expert.  The order may be made only on
motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties
and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the
person or persons by whom it is to be made.</p>

            <p>A minor subject to examination under the provisions of this Article shall have the
right to have a parent, tutor, or legal guardian present during the examination.  If such person
cannot be present, the court shall order the examination to be videotaped at the expense of
the party being examined.  The court shall consider the best interests of the minor and may
impose conditions upon videotaping, including that it be done in a manner least harmful to
the minor and without disclosure to the minor.</p>
