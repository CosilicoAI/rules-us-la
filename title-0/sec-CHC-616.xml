            <p>The department shall maintain a state repository of all reports of abuse and
neglect. The purpose of this state repository, among other uses, is to provide information of
past reports of child abuse or neglect of children to assist in the proper evaluation of current
reports of abuse or neglect which may include a pattern of incidents.</p>

            <p>Within the state repository, the department shall maintain a state central registry
of certain  substantiated reports of abuse and neglect as set forth in rules promulgated by the
department. The name of an individual who was placed on the state central registry as a
perpetrator of abuse or neglect prior to the effective date of Article 616.1.1 shall not be
released outside of the department until that individual's administrative appeals are
exhausted. After the effective date of Article 616.1.1, the name of an individual who is
determined to be a perpetrator of abuse or neglect shall not be placed on the state central
registry until that individual's administrative appeals are exhausted. All decisions rendered
by an administrative law judge are final, and the decisions shall exhaust the individual's
administrative remedy. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department
shall provide information involving an investigation from either the repository or the state
central registry immediately to the local district attorney's office, or its designee, or to the
court, when taking court action is necessary to protect the child from abuse or neglect. The
department shall provide information involving an open investigation or a completed
investigation determined to be  substantiated from either the repository or the state central
registry to another state's child welfare agency upon written request when the request is made
pursuant to an ongoing child protective services investigation in the other state.</p>
