            <p>If both parents have acknowledged their child born outside of marriage, the judge
shall appoint as tutor the one by whose care the best interests of the child will be served.
However, if the parents are awarded joint custody of such acknowledged child born outside
of marriage, then the cotutorship of such child shall belong of right to both parents, with
equal authority to act alone, on behalf of the child, and with equal privileges and
responsibilities, unless modified by order of the court or by an agreement of the parents,
approved by the court awarding joint custody.</p>
