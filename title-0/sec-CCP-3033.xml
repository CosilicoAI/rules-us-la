          <p>Art. 3033.  Same; compensation of executor
If the testament is dated prior to January 1, 1961, the person named therein as executor shall be entitled to the full compensation allowed by law for an executor's services in administering a testate succession, even though he may not have been confirmed as executor.
If the testament is dated subsequent to December 31, 1960, the person named therein as executor shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for the services which he has rendered, whether he has been confirmed as executor or not.
Except as provided hereinafter, the legatees may be sent into possession only if the person named in the testament as executor joins in the petition thereof.
If the residuary legatee and the person named in the testament as executor cannot agree upon the compensation due him, or for any other reason he refuses to join in the petition for possession, the residuary legatee may rule him into court to show cause why the compensation due should not be determined judicially, and why the legatees should not be sent into possession of their legacies.  The court shall not send the legatees into possession until satisfactory proof has been submitted that the compensation determined to be due the person named in the testament as executor has been paid.</p>
