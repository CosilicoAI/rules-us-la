          <p>Art. 1390.  Scope of warranty as to corporeal and incorporeal things.
Warranty between coheirs has two different effects, according to the two kinds of property which may exist in the succession:
One composed of things which corporeally exist, whether they be movable or immovable, with regard to which warranty goes no farther than assuring them to belong to the succession.
The other kind consists of active debts and other rights, and with respect to these, they are not only guaranteed as belonging to the succession, but also as being such as they appear to be; that is to say, as being really due to the succession, and due by debtors solvent at the time of the partition, and who shall be so when the debt becomes payable, if it be not then due.</p>
