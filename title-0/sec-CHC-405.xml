against any party to a petition, and no salaried officer of the state or of any parish or

court in any such proceedings.  Except as otherwise provided in R.S. 13:4521, all other

provided by law for like services in cases before the district court.</p>

inhabitants, in all proceedings under Chapter 2 of Title XIII of this Code and R.S. 14:74 et
seq. after a conviction or plea of guilty, the court in its discretion, instead of imposing the
punishment or fine, or both, provided therein, having issued an order directing the defendant
to pay a certain sum weekly or at such periods as the court may direct, may assess costs
against the defendant not to exceed five percent of all sums paid weekly or periodically
through the registry of the court.</p>

            <p>In parishes having a population between two hundred twenty-five thousand and
four hundred fifty thousand, in all proceedings under Chapter 2 of Title XIII of this Code and
R.S. 14:74 et seq. where the defendant has violated the terms of such order as provided
therein and the defendant is adjudged guilty of contempt by failing to comply with the
judgment or order of the court by paying the support assessed, the court may assess costs
against the defendant in an amount not to exceed five percent of the fine imposed by the
court for the contempt of its order or judgment; however, in no case shall the fine and costs
together exceed the sum of five hundred dollars.</p>
