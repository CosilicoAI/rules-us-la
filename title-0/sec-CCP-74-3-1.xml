            <p>A person applying for a marriage license who is unable to provide a birth
certificate, letter required by R.S. 9:227, a valid and unexpired passport, or visa accompanied
by Form I-94 as issued by the United States may provide a Certificate of Naturalization by
the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Authority. A person applying for a marriage license
who is unable to provide a social security number may provide a driver's license, a
government issued identification card, a passport, a visa issued by the United States
Department of State, or a Certificate of Naturalization issued by the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services. A person applying for a marriage license who is
unable to comply with the requirements of this Article may seek judicial authorization for
waiver of the requirements of this Article. The court may grant the waiver and order the
issuance of the marriage license if, after hearing and good cause shown, the court finds that
such relief is appropriate and that the person has complied with other legal requirements for
the marriage license. The hearing may be conducted in camera, and before a duty judge. The
written order granting the waiver shall be attached to the marriage license application. If the
court denies the waiver, the court shall provide reasons for the denial of the waiver.</p>

within their territorial jurisdiction, or by a justice of the peace court or city court if the
