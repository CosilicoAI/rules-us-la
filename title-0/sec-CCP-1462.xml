            <p>The request under Article 1461 may, without leave of court, be served upon the
plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of
the petition upon that party.  The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by
individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable
particularity.  The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the
inspection and performing the related acts.  The request may specify the form or forms in
which information, including electronically stored information, is to be produced.

Paragraph.  The court may allow a shorter or longer time.  With respect to each item or
category, the response shall state that inspection and related activities will be permitted as
requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be
stated.  If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified.  The
written answer or reasons for objection to each request for production of documents shall
immediately follow a restatement of the request for production of documents to which the
answer or objection is responding.  The party submitting the request may move for an order
under Article 1469 with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request,
or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.  If objection is made to
the requested form or forms for producing information, including electronically stored
information, or if no form was specified in the request, the responding party shall state in its
response the form or forms it intends to use.</p>

              <p>A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from
sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. 
On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is
sought shall show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden
or cost.  If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such
sources if the requesting party shows good cause.  The court may specify conditions for the
discovery considering the criteria and limitations of Article 1426.</p>

            <p>A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are
kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the
categories of the request.  If a request does not specify the form or forms for producing
information, including electronically stored information, a responding party shall produce
the information in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a form or forms
that are reasonably usable.  When electronically stored information is produced, the
responding party shall identify the specific means for electronically accessing the
information.</p>

            <p>If the requesting party considers that the production of designated electronically
stored information is not in compliance with the request, the requesting party may move
under Article 1469 for an order compelling discovery, and in addition to the other relief
afforded by Article 1469, upon a showing of good cause by the requesting party, the court
may order the responding party to afford access under specified conditions and scope to the
requesting party, the representative of the requesting party, or the designee of the court to the
computers or other types of devices used for the electronic storage of information to inspect,
copy, test, and sample the designated electronically stored information within the scope of
Articles 1422 and 1425.</p>
