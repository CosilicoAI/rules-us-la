            <content>
              <p>After the seizure of property, the sheriff shall serve promptly upon the
judgment debtor, in the manner provided for service of citation, a written notice of the
seizure and a list of the property seized.  The notice of seizure shall be accomplished by
personal service or domiciliary service.  If service cannot be made on the judgment debtor
or his attorney of record, the court shall appoint an attorney upon whom service may be
made.  The notice of seizure shall include information concerning the time, date, and place
of the sheriff's sale, in accordance with the form provided in R.S. 13:3852(B).  If the sheriff's
sale is to be conducted through an online auction in accordance with Article 2344, the notice
of seizure, or a subsequent notice served upon the judgment debtor at least three days before
the sale, shall state that the sheriff's sale will be conducted through an online auction, shall
specify the date of the online auction and the time when bidding is scheduled to open, and
shall identify the electronic address of the platform through which bids can be entered.  In
the case of seizure of residential property, the notice of seizure shall include information
concerning the availability of housing counseling services, in accordance with the form
provided in R.S. 13:3852(B).</p>

              <p>of this Paragraph, the sheriff shall also serve upon the
occupants of the seized property a written notice stating that the subject property has been
seized.  Such service shall be accomplished by directing the notice to &quot;occupants&quot; of the
seized premises and if the notice cannot be served personally or by domiciliary service upon
the occupants, such service shall be accomplished by posting the notice upon the main
entrance to the seized premises.  The failure to serve the notices as provided herein shall not
invalidate the sheriff's sale; however, such failure shall prevent the purchaser at  the sheriff's
sale from availing himself of the provisions of R.S. 13:4346 as it applies to the ejectment or
eviction of any occupants of the seized premises other than the judgment debtor.  The failure
to serve the notices required in this Paragraph shall not affect the rights of the foreclosing
creditor or of the purchaser at the sheriff's sale under Code of Civil Procedure Articles 4701
et seq.

any interested party to cancel the notice of seizure of property affected by the mortgage upon
submitting a request to cancel evidencing that the mortgage has been cancelled and upon

basis of prescription of ten years without submitting evidence that all costs due to the clerk
of court and sheriff have been paid in full.
