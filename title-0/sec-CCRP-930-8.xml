            <p>No application for post conviction relief, including applications which seek an
out-of-time appeal, shall be considered if it is filed more than two years after the judgment
of conviction and sentence has become final under the provisions of Article 914 or 922,
unless any of the following apply:</p>
          </content>
          <paragraph eId="CCRP-930-8__subsec_A__subsec_1">
            <num>(1)</num>
            <content>
              <p>The application alleges, and the petitioner proves or the state admits, that the
facts upon which the claim is predicated were not known to the petitioner or his prior
attorneys.  Further, the petitioner shall prove that he exercised diligence in attempting to
discover any post conviction claims that may exist.  &quot;Diligence&quot; for the purposes of this
Article is a subjective inquiry that shall take into account the circumstances of the petitioner. 
Those circumstances shall include but are not limited to the educational background of the
petitioner, the petitioner's access to formally trained inmate counsel, the financial resources
of the petitioner, the age of the petitioner, the mental abilities of the petitioner, or whether
the interests of justice will be served by the consideration of new evidence.  New facts
discovered pursuant to this exception shall be submitted to the court within two years of
discovery.  If the petitioner pled guilty or nolo contendere to the offense of conviction and
is seeking relief pursuant to Article 926.2 and five years or more have elapsed since the
petitioner pled guilty or nolo contendere to the offense of conviction, the petitioner shall not
be eligible for the exception provided for by this Subparagraph.

                <p>Facts that were known to any attorney for the petitioner shall be presumed to
have been known by the petitioner unless the petitioner rebuts this presumption by clear and
convincing evidence.  Facts that were contained in the record of the court proceedings
concerning the conviction challenged in the application shall be deemed to have been known
by the petitioner. The provisions of this Subparagraph are applicable if the petitioner proves
both of the following:</p>

conviction claims or facts upon which any claims may be based.
(ii) That exceptional circumstances exist, the interest of justice will be served by
consideration of the claim based upon the previously unknown facts, and the newly
discovered facts in support of the claim are sufficiently compelling that manifest injustice
will result if the claim is not considered.</p>

            <p>An application for post conviction relief which is timely filed, or which is allowed
under an exception to the time limitation as set forth in Paragraph A of this Article, shall be
dismissed upon a showing by the state of prejudice to its ability to respond to, negate, or
rebut the allegations of the petition caused by events not under the control of the state which
have transpired since the date of original conviction, if the court finds, after a hearing limited
to that issue, that the state's ability to respond to, negate, or rebut such allegations has been
materially prejudiced thereby.  When the petitioner fails to timely seek a hearing that is
allowed by law or fails to pursue claims for a period of two years after filing an application,
the delay caused by inaction shall be presumed as prejudicial.  The petitioner shall bear the
burden of rebutting the presumption of prejudice.  A final judgment dismissing an
application based upon prejudice shall be a final adjudication of state post conviction claims
in the application for purposes of exhaustion of state court remedies and federal habeas
corpus proceedings.</p>
