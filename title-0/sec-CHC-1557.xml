&quot;DECLARATION
Declaration made this _____ day of ______________ (month, year)
I, _______________, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desire that the death of my dying child, __________________________________, shall not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth below and do hereby declare:
Because my child has an incurable condition, injury, disease, or illness certified to be terminal and irreversible by two physicians who have personally examined my child, one of whom is his attending physician, and the physicians have determined that my child's death will occur whether or not life-sustaining procedures are utilized and that the application of life-sustaining procedures will serve only to prolong artificially the dying process, I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn and that my child be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide him with comfort care.
I understand the full import of this declaration, and I am emotionally and mentally competent to make this declaration on behalf of my child.
Signed _________________________
City, Parish, and State of Residence ______________________
The declarant has been personally known to me and I believe him or her to be of sound mind.
