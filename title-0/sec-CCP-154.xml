            <p>A party desiring to recuse a judge of a district court shall file a written motion
therefor assigning the ground for recusal under Article 151.  This motion shall be filed no
later than thirty days after discovery of the facts constituting the ground upon which the
motion is based, but in all cases prior to the scheduling of the matter for trial.  In the event
that the facts constituting the ground upon which the motion to recuse is based occur after
the matter is scheduled for trial or the party moving for recusal could not, in the exercise of
due diligence, have discovered such facts, the motion to recuse shall be filed immediately
after such facts occur or are discovered.</p>

            <p>If the motion to recuse sets forth a ground for recusal under Article 151, not later
than seven days after the judge's receipt of the motion from the clerk of court, the judge shall
either recuse himself or make a written request to the supreme court for the appointment of
an ad hoc judge as provided in Article 155.</p>

            <p>If the motion to recuse is not timely filed in accordance with Paragraph A of this
Article or fails to set forth a ground for recusal under Article 151, the judge may deny the
motion without the appointment of an ad hoc judge or a hearing but shall provide written
reasons for the denial.</p>
