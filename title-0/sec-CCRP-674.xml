            <p>A party desiring to recuse a trial judge shall file a written motion therefor
assigning the ground for recusal under Article 671.  The motion shall be filed not later than
thirty days after discovery of the facts constituting the ground upon which the motion is
based, but in all cases at least thirty days prior to commencement of the trial.  In the event
that the facts constituting the ground for recusal occur thereafter or the party moving for
recusal could not, in the exercise of due diligence, have discovered such facts, the motion to
recuse shall be filed immediately after the facts occur or are discovered, but prior to verdict
or judgment.</p>

            <p>If the motion to recuse sets forth facts constituting a ground for recusal under
Article 671, not later than seven days after the judge's receipt of the motion from the clerk
of court, the judge shall either recuse himself or refer the motion for hearing to another judge
or to an ad hoc judge as provided in Article 675.</p>

            <p>If the motion to recuse is not timely filed in accordance with Paragraph A of this
Article or fails to set forth facts constituting a ground for recusal under Article 671, the judge
may deny the motion without referring the motion to another judge or to an ad hoc judge for
hearing but shall provide written reasons for the denial.</p>
