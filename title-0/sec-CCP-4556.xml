            <p>Upon producing proof of his appointment, a conservator who was appointed by
a court outside of Louisiana may appear in court on behalf of the protected person without
qualifying as a curator according to the law of Louisiana when no curator has been appointed
in this state. In accordance with the authority set forth in his letters, such a conservator may
perform acts affecting the protected person's property in Louisiana when authorized by the
court of the parish in which the property is located. Once so authorized, the conservator shall
act in the same manner and in accordance with the same procedures as a curator appointed
by a court in Louisiana. Whenever the action of an undercurator would be necessary, the
court shall appoint an undercurator ad hoc.</p>

            <p>In order to take possession of the protected person's property, or to remove any
of it from the state, a conservator appointed by a court outside Louisiana shall file a petition
for authority to do so in the court of the parish in which any of the property is located. The
court shall render a judgment granting the authority prayed for if the foreign conservator
alleges in the petition that there are no Louisiana creditors of the protected person, or that all
such known creditors have been paid, and if the foreign conservator attaches to the petition
an irrevocable power of attorney appointing a resident of this state to receive service of
process in any action or proceeding brought in Louisiana to enforce a claim against the
protected person, or against any of the protected person's property located in this state.</p>
