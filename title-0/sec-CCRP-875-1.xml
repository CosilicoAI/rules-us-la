            <p>The purpose of imposing financial obligations on an offender who is convicted
of a criminal offense is to hold the offender accountable for his action, to compensate victims
for any actual pecuniary loss or costs incurred in connection with a criminal prosecution, to
defray the cost of court operations, and to provide services to offenders and victims.  These
financial obligations should not create a barrier to the offender's successful rehabilitation and
reentry into society.  Financial obligations in excess of what an offender can reasonably pay
undermine the primary purpose of the justice system which is to deter criminal behavior and
encourage compliance with the law.  Financial obligations that cause undue hardship on the
offender should be waived, modified, or forgiven.  Creating a payment plan for the offender
that is based upon the ability to pay, results in financial obligations that the offender is able
to comply with and often results in more money collected.  Offenders who are consistent in
their payments and in good faith try to fulfill their financial obligations should be rewarded
for their efforts.</p>

            <p>For purposes of this Article, &quot;financial obligations&quot; shall include any fine, fee,
cost, restitution, or other monetary obligation authorized by this Code or by the Louisiana
Revised Statutes of 1950 and imposed upon the defendant as part of a criminal sentence,
incarceration, or as a condition of the defendant's release on probation or parole.

              <p>Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, prior to ordering the
imposition or enforcement of any financial obligations as defined by this Article, the court
shall conduct a hearing to determine whether payment in full of the aggregate amount of all
the financial obligations to be imposed upon the defendant would cause substantial financial
hardship to the defendant or his dependents.  The court may consider, among other factors,
whether any victim of the crime has incurred a substantial financial hardship as a result of
the criminal act or acts and whether the defendant is employed. The court may delay the
hearing to determine substantial financial hardship for a period not to exceed ninety days, in
order to permit either party to submit relevant evidence.</p>

              <p>The defendant or the court may waive the judicial determination of a substantial
financial hardship required by the provisions of this Paragraph.  If the court waives the
hearing on its own motion, the court shall provide reasons, entered upon the record, for its
determination that the defendant is capable of paying the fines, fees, and penalties imposed
without causing a substantial financial hardship.
