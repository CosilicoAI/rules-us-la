              <p>If the court orders the defendant to be equipped with a global positioning
monitoring system as a condition of release on bail, the court may order the defendant, with
the informed consent of the victim, to provide the victim of the charged crime with an
electronic receptor device which is capable of receiving the global positioning system
information and which notifies the victim if the defendant is located within an established
proximity to the victim.  The court, in consultation with the victim, shall determine which
areas the defendant shall be prohibited from accessing and shall establish the proximity to
the victim within which a defendant shall be excluded.  In making this determination, the
court shall consider a list, provided by the victim, which includes those areas from which the
victim desires the defendant to be excluded.</p>

              <p>Crimes of violence.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph G of this
Article and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if the defendant is
alleged to have committed a crime of violence as defined in R.S. 14:2(B), the court shall
require as a condition of bail that the defendant refrain from going to the residence or
household of the victim, the victim's school, and the victim's place of employment or
otherwise contacting the victim in any manner whatsoever, and shall refrain from having any
further contact with the victim.  The court shall also require as a condition of bail that the
defendant be prohibited from communicating, by electronic communication, in writing, or
orally, with a victim of the offense, or with any of the victim's immediate family members.
This condition does not apply if the victim consents by way of a request to the court and the
court issues an order permitting the communication.  If an immediate family member of the
victim consents by way of a request to the court and the court issues an order permitting the
communication, then the defendant may contact that person.</p>
